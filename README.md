# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 4 - Resveratrol production in S. cerevisiae


## Project summary (<300 words)
The aim of this study is to identify and reconstruct a GSM capable of producing resveratrol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for industrial purposes. We propose a suitable pathway for production of resveratrol with maximum productivity along with identification of targets (knockouts, downregulation, overexpression and co-factors) to maximize the yield.

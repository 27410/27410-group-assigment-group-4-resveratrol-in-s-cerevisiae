# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 4 - Resveratrol production in S. cerevisiae

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
The aim of this study is to identify and reconstruct a GSM capable of producing resveratrol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for industrial purposes. We propose a suitable pathway for production of resveratrol with maximum productivity along with identification of targets (knockouts, downregulation, overexpression and co-factors) to maximize the yield.  

## Project overview

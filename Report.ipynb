    "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used more than any other yeast species as a cell factory for resveratrol production. Throughout the years, many different strains have been annotated, curated and improved due to the high interest in industrial applications and de novo synthesis of products. Nevertheless, no GSMM is currently available for the specific strain that is used for resveratrol production optimization, the CEN.PK102-5B. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to choose the optimal GSM available, we compared the models iMM904 and Yeast8 using memote by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability. iMM904was reconstructed based on the existing GSM iND750 and validated by comparing 2,888 in silico single-gene deletion strain growth phenotype predictions to published experimental data, where the predicted intracellular flux changes were consistent with previously published data (Mo et al., 2009).  Yeast8 is the current consensus genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, continuously updated and tracked on a GitHub repository.  For its development, several databases were used for gene annotation, resulting in an enriched GSM (Lu et al., 2019). \n",
